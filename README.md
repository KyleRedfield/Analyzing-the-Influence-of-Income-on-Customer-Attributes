The data used in this project was obtained from an online course. Although the specific sources and collection methods are not provided, it is essential to note that this dataset is intended for educational purposes. As such, it may not fully reflect real-world socioeconomic or demographic trends. However, it serves as an excellent resource for practicing data analysis techniques.

## Goals of the Project
Our main project goal is to analyze the dataset and examine how income relates to other attributes within it. We aim to uncover correlations between income and various customer features, including education, marital status, and purchasing behavior. By identifying these relationships, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing income and their implications for marketing strategies and customer engagement. This analysis offers valuable insights for businesses looking to make data-informed decisions and tailor their approaches to different customer segments, extending beyond education to provide a holistic view of the dataset's dynamics.
